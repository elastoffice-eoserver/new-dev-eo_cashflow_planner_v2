        DEMO DATA - Cashflow Planner V2 - TEMPORARILY DISABLED
        ========================================================================

        Purpose: Provide realistic demo data to help users understand the system

        Data included:
        1. Demo Budgets (Q1 2025 for various categories)
        2. Demo Planned Items (income and payments for next 3 months)
        3. Demo Recurring Items (monthly rent, salaries, subscriptions)

        Note: Demo data temporarily disabled due to Odoo 7 computed field
              store parameter issue during initial data load.

        The demo data file has been preserved for future use once the
        computed field trigger optimization is completed.

        Users can create their own budgets, planned items, and recurring items
        manually through the web interface.
